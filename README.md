# hello-world
My first repository

A little bit about myself: I like games, being at the computer and staying at home. I like warm weather and I'm most definetily not cut out for cold weather.
I like Drupal, creating things from scratch and watch them come to live. I am the kind of person who has to delete and start from scratch more times than recommended.
